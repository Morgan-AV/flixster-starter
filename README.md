### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

The topics on the assignment did prepare us for the project. The weather app taught us the basics and acted as a guide to creating functions.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
I would've completed the stretch features and styled more to give the site a more professional and functional look. 

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

What went well was the implementation of React. With prior JS experience from project 2, it felt smoother to transition into React.
